Features Implemented
-------------------------------
1. Script Input
	When the project script is executed, the user is prompted to enter their name
	and then asked if they would like to see the TODO Log, which is the only other
	feature in the script
2. TODO Log
	When requested, the TODO log searches through every file within the CS1XA3 directory
	and returns, line by line, every line with the phrase '#TODO' in it.
