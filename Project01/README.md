Features Implemented
-------------------------------
1. Script Input
	When the project script is executed, the user is prompted to enter their name
	and then asked if they would like to see the TODO Log. If they do not say yes,
	they are asked if they would like to see the File Type Count.
2. TODO Log
	When requested, the TODO log searches through every file within the CS1XA3 directory
	and returns, line by line, every line with the phrase '#TODO' in it.
3. File Type Count
	When requested, the File Type Count searches every file name within the CS1XA3 directory
	and returns the count of certain extensions found (HTML, Bash, CSS, Python, Haskell,
	JavaScript).
4. Name Search
	Since the user has already typed in their name, upon request, this features searches
	every file within the CS1XA3 directory and returns, line by line, every line with the
	user's name that they previously entered.
